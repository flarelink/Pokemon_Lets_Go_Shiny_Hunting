# Pokemon_Lets_Go_Shiny_Hunting
Project to use computer vision to detect shiny pokemon in the Nintendo Switch Pokemon: Let's Go games.

Update: This project hasn't been updated in a long while and it's because back when I was initially doing work on it I was in university. I found that having to label bounding boxes for the pokemon in images was tedious. I may come back to this at a future point, but currently don't have any immediate plans to.
